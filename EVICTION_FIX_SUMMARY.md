# Context Manager Eviction Fix Summary

## Problem

The context manager eviction system was failing with warnings like:
```
[WARN] Cannot evict: only system messages or current user message available
[WARN] Cannot calculate messages to evict, stopping eviction
```

This caused the context to exceed its maximum token limit, leading to undefined behavior.

## Root Cause

The issue occurred in `ContextManager::add_message()` (context_manager.cpp:38-81):

1. Messages were added to the context **before** checking if eviction was needed
2. When `evict_oldest_messages()` was called, it would fail if only system messages and the current user message remained (nothing evictable)
3. The context would exceed its limit, but the message was already added

### Example Scenario

```
Context size: 600 tokens
System message: 500 tokens
User message: 250 tokens
Total: 750 tokens (exceeds 600!)
```

Since only system + user messages exist, eviction fails and context overflows to 133% capacity.

## Solution

Modified `ContextManager::add_message()` to check **before** adding:

### Key Changes (context_manager.cpp:38-70)

1. **Pre-check eviction**: Before adding a message, calculate if it will exceed the limit
2. **Validate eviction**: Call `calculate_messages_to_evict()` to check if eviction is possible
3. **Fail fast**: If eviction cannot free enough space, throw `ContextManagerError` **before** adding the message
4. **Direct eviction**: Use `evict_messages_by_index()` directly with calculated indices instead of `evict_oldest_messages()`
5. **Verify success**: Confirm enough space was freed before proceeding

### New Behavior

**Before Fix:**
- Add message → context overflows → eviction fails → WARNING logged → context remains invalid (133% capacity)

**After Fix:**
- Check if message fits → eviction fails → EXCEPTION thrown → context remains valid → caller must handle error

## Testing

Created comprehensive test suite (`test_eviction_simple.cpp`) covering:

### Test 1: Edge Case - System + Single User Only
- ✓ Small context with large system message
- ✓ Attempts to add user message that would overflow
- ✓ **Expected**: Throws `ContextManagerError` with clear message
- ✓ **Result**: Context remains valid, message rejected

### Test 2: Normal Eviction - Multiple Turns
- ✓ Multiple conversation turns filling context
- ✓ Automatic eviction of old turns
- ✓ **Expected**: Eviction succeeds, old turns archived to RAG
- ✓ **Result**: Context maintains ~62% utilization, eviction working perfectly

## Benefits

1. **Prevents context overflow**: Context never exceeds maximum token limit
2. **Clear error messages**: Exceptions explain why message cannot be added
3. **Context integrity**: Context remains in valid state even when eviction fails
4. **Better debugging**: Errors surface immediately instead of silent warnings

## API Impact

### Breaking Change
Code that previously silently overflowed will now throw `ContextManagerError`:

```cpp
try {
    context_manager->add_message(message);
} catch (const ContextManagerError& e) {
    // Handle case where message cannot fit
    // Typically: truncate system message, split user message, or reject request
}
```

### Non-Breaking Cases
- Normal operation: No changes needed
- Sufficient context space: Works as before
- Successful eviction: Transparent to caller

## Files Modified

1. **context_manager.cpp** (`add_message()` method)
   - Added pre-eviction validation
   - Changed to throw exception on eviction failure
   - Direct eviction using calculated indices

## Build and Test

```bash
# Build standalone test
g++ -std=c++17 -O0 -g -o test_eviction_simple test_eviction_simple.cpp

# Run tests
./test_eviction_simple

# Expected output:
# ✓ Edge Case test throws exception correctly
# ✓ Normal Eviction test passes
# All tests completed!
```

## Recommendations

1. **Application Layer**: Add try-catch around `add_message()` calls in API backends
2. **User-Facing Errors**: Map `ContextManagerError` to user-friendly messages like "Message too large for context window"
3. **System Message Size**: Consider limiting system prompt size to ensure user messages can fit
4. **Context Monitoring**: Log context utilization metrics to detect patterns approaching limits
