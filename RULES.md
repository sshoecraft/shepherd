**CRITICAL:**
- No examples!
- No samples!
- No mock data or static data or fake data to test with!
- No "TODO in the code" or unimplemented functionality to "get it working" or "test this out"
- No "simple" functions when troubleshooting - fix the actual code
- Don't create _new or _old etc ... just use the same filenames! if you need to make a backup copy whatever your working on to XXX.backup
- DO NOT use the git command for _ANY REASON_ unless you are directed to
- DO NOT! I REPEAT _DO NOT_ _EVER_ ... I MEAN EVER ... USE git to "restore" changes
- DO NOT EVER edit the Makefile without being told to do so
- DO NOT use any file in an "old" directory

**CODING STYLE**:
- DO NOT put an underscore suffix (_) after variable names
- DO NOT use accessor functions for variable names
- DO NOT make all class variables private - only use private variables when no outside sources require them
- DO NOT use "Manager" in the name of any classes
- When making changes, be sure to rev the patch version for fixes/patches, the minor version for new features, and major version for major changes

**CRITICAL RULES WHEN COMMITNG TO GITHUB OR ISSUING PRS:**
- DO NOT put any icons or graphics that indicate claude code is being used - just list the items in bullet points in a clear concise manner
- DO NOT put at the end: 🤖 Generated with Claude Code
- DO NOT give any indication an claude was used - like "<user> and claude ..." etc
