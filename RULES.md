**CRITICAL:**
- No examples!
- No samples!
- No mock data or static data or fake data to test with!
- No "TODO in the code" or unimplemented functionality to "get it working" or "test this out"
- No "simple" functions when troubleshooting - fix the actual code
- Don't create _new or _old etc ... just use the same filenames! if you need to make a backup copy whatever your working on to XXX.backup
