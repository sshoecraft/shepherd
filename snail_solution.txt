Snail Climbing Problem Solution:

Problem: A snail climbs a 20-foot wall. Each day it climbs up 3 feet, but each night it slides down 2 feet. On which day does it reach the top?

Solution:
- After (n-1) full cycles: net progress = (n-1)*(3-2) = n-1 feet
- On day n: climbs 3 feet to reach (n-1)+3 = n+2 feet  
- Need: n+2 ≥ 20, so n ≥ 18
- Answer: Day 18

General Formula:
For wall height H, daily climb C, nightly slide S:

If C ≥ H: reaches on day 1
Else if C ≤ S and H > 0: impossible to reach (no progress)
Else:
    n = ceil(1 + (H-C)/(C-S))
    Answer: day n

Edge Cases Analysis:
1. If C ≥ H, reaches immediately on day 1
2. If C ≤ S and H > 0, impossible (no net progress)
3. The problem assumes the snail can make progress each day (C > S)
